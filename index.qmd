# About

### About the meeting

This priority setting meeting aims to bring together key stakeholders, including consumers, who work and/or have lived experience in neurodevelopmental care for children with congenital heart disease (CHD). It builds on established networks and partnerships in the CHD LIFE+ program of research and in a range of CHD children and family care settings and contexts. The meeting aims to extend and sustain these collaborative networks beyond the life of the CHD LIFE+ study and into a future.

This event is led by the Australian Centre for Health Services Innovation (AusHSI), Queensland University of Technology (QUT), and Queensland Paediatric Cardiac Service (QPCS), Children’s Health Queensland (CHQ).


### Impacts

This forum aims to inform future initiatives, funding, and delivery of neurodevelopmental care for families and children with CHD. It will provide a platform for consumer advocates and expert input into collaborative priority setting for best practice neurodevelopmental care for children with CHD.

The meeting will be co-facilitated with and informed by our strong collaborative partnership with HeartKids, and the information collected will help shape reporting of the discussion and priorities. Relevant study protocol and ethics approval will be sought to enable these activities to be published.Workshop description

The Health Services Research Association of Australia and New Zealand (HSRAANZ) is pleased to announce a half-day workshop on Implementation Science Skills in Practice, to be delivered by members of the Queensland University of Technology’s Australian Centre for Health Services Innovation (AusHSI).

## Do you have more to say? 

We would like to offer you the chance to provide any further comments or information that you think we should consider as part of today’s priority setting meeting. 

Please note, we will qualitatively analyse, synthesise and summarise all responses, aiming to include this data in the final report and any publications where possible. Please follow this [link](https://qsurvey.qut.edu.au/jfe/form/SV_0fgdWbDfcab4nXg) to access an online form to provide any additional comments. 

The form will remain open for 2 working days  (i.e. will close at 5pm on Monday 10th November). 
Data will be collected anonymously unless you choose to share you name/details with us.

## Evaluation survey

After the meeting, we’ll send out a short evaluation survey to gather your feedback on the meeting processes, methods, and outcomes.

**Why we’re doing this survey:** We want to learn how well the priority setting process worked - what went well, what could be better, and whether the right priorities were chosen. Your feedback will help us improve this kind of activity in the future.
