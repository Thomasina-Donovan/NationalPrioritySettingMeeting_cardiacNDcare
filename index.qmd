# Have your say


## Vote on the importance and feasibility of each priority 

Use your personal device (phone or laptop) to vote electronically on the importance and feasibility of each priority.

1.  **Open the questionnaire**:
    *    [Follow this link](https://www.menti.com/aln8x9bh2hcq) to Mentimeter. 
    *    Or join at [menti.com](https://www.menti.com/) | use code **5756 7874** 

2. **Rate each priority** from 1 (not important/feasible) to 10( very important/feasible) based on:
   *    **Importance**: How critical or impactful is actioning this priority for improving neurodevelopmental outcomes and follow-up care for children with CHD in Australia?
   *    **Feasibility**: How realistically and easily can this priority be actioned within our current capacity (e.g., time, budget, skills, partnerships, infrastructure, policy)? 

3. **View the results**:
After voting, Mentimeter will display the average scores on a 2x2 matrix, showing all priorities plotted by importance and feasibility.

### About the Matrix
The **Importance–Feasibility Matrix** helps evaluate tasks, projects, or ideas based on their potential impact and effort required. This visual tool supports better resource allocation and decision-making.

**Categories:**

*    ***Quick wins***: High importance, high feasibility
*    ***Major projects***: High importance, low feasibility
*    ***Low-impact tasks***: Low importance, high feasibility
*    ***Time-consuming tasks***: Low importance, low feasibility


## Provide feedback on priorities

**Do you have more to say?**

We would like to offer you the chance to provide any further comments or information that you think we should consider as part of today’s priority setting meeting. 

Please note, we will qualitatively analyse, synthesise and summarise all responses, aiming to include this data in the final report and any publications where possible. 

[Follow this link](https://qsurvey.qut.edu.au/jfe/form/SV_0fgdWbDfcab4nXg) to access an online form to provide any additional comments. 

The form will remain **open for 2 working days**  (i.e. will close at 5pm on Monday 10th November). 
Data will be collected anonymously unless you choose to share you name/details with us.

## Evaluation survey

After the meeting, you'll be invited to complete a short evaluation survey to gather your feedback on the meeting processes, methods, and outcomes.

To complete the survey, navigate to the *post-event evaluation survey* tab and follow the link. Or wait for an email in the coming weeks.


# Post-Event Evaluation Survey

## Post-Event Evaluation Survey

Thank you for taking part in the CHD LIFE+ National Priority Setting Meeting. We’d like to invite you to take part in a short survey to help us understand how well the methods and activities worked during the meeting. 

This survey will open for responses **from 4pm on Thursday** the 6th November and remain open **for two weeks**. We will also email all of today’s participants a link to the survey next week.

#### Why we’re doing this survey

We want to learn how well the priority setting process worked - what went well, what could be better, and whether the right priorities were chosen. We are also evaluating the specific methods we used like 25/10 crowdsourcing and the feasibility/importance matrix. Your feedback will help us improve this kind of activity in the future. The survey has [X] questions and should take about x minutes to finish.

#### Your choice to take part

You don’t have to do the survey if you don’t want to. Even if you said yes to being part of the research and meeting before, you can still change your mind now. You can skip any questions you don’t want to answer, and you can stop the survey at any time by closing your browser.

# About

### About the meeting

This priority setting meeting aims to bring together key stakeholders, including consumers, who work and/or have lived experience in neurodevelopmental care for children with congenital heart disease (CHD). It builds on established networks and partnerships in the CHD LIFE+ program of research and in a range of CHD children and family care settings and contexts. The meeting aims to extend and sustain these collaborative networks beyond the life of the CHD LIFE+ study and into the future.

This event is led by the Australian Centre for Health Services Innovation (AusHSI), Queensland University of Technology (QUT), and Queensland Paediatric Cardiac Service (QPCS), Children’s Health Queensland (CHQ).


### Impacts

This forum aims to inform future initiatives, funding, and delivery of neurodevelopmental care for families and children with CHD. It will provide a platform for consumer advocates and expert input into collaborative priority setting for best practice neurodevelopmental care for children with CHD.

The meeting will be co-facilitated with and informed by our strong collaborative partnership with HeartKids, and the information collected will help shape reporting of the discussion and priorities. Relevant study protocol and ethics approval were approved to enable these activities to be published.


# Pre-reading

## Briefing paper

A briefing paper was developed to explain how things currently work when it comes to caring for children with congenital heart disease (CHD) and their families across Australia. The paper looks at what’s helping, what’s getting in the way, and where there might be room to improve. It was based on earlier work from the CHD LIFE+ research program. 

It’s purpose is to provide a clear picture of the current situation so that the meeting can start with a shared understanding and focus on what’s next. This briefing paper starts by outlining the event and then explains why it is needed.

## About CHD LIFE+
The national priority setting meeting will be held as a culminating event of the CHD LIFE+ program of research.

The CHD LIFE+ program of research aims to evaluate existing and potential models of care for CHD neurodevelopmental support to inform future practice. 

CHD LIFE+ is a partnership between those listed below and on Page 3 of the briefing paper. It is funded by a MRFF Cardiovascular Mission Congenital Heart Disease Grant (ARGCHDG0035) 2020-2025.
