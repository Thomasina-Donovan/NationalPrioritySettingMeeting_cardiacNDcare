# About

### About the meeting

This priority setting meeting aims to bring together key stakeholders, including consumers, who work and/or have lived experience in neurodevelopmental care for children with congenital heart disease (CHD). It builds on established networks and partnerships in the CHD LIFE+ program of research and in a range of CHD children and family care settings and contexts. The meeting aims to extend and sustain these collaborative networks beyond the life of the CHD LIFE+ study and into a future.

This event is led by the Australian Centre for Health Services Innovation (AusHSI), Queensland University of Technology (QUT), and Queensland Paediatric Cardiac Service (QPCS), Children’s Health Queensland (CHQ).


### Impacts

This forum aims to inform future initiatives, funding, and delivery of neurodevelopmental care for families and children with CHD. It will provide a platform for consumer advocates and expert input into collaborative priority setting for best practice neurodevelopmental care for children with CHD.

The meeting will be co-facilitated with and informed by our strong collaborative partnership with HeartKids, and the information collected will help shape reporting of the discussion and priorities. Relevant study protocol and ethics approval will be sought to enable these activities to be published.Workshop description
